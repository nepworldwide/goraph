## Algorithms Introduction

* BFS: breadth first search.

* DFS: depth first search.

* TopologicalSort: is a linear ordering of a directed graph's vertices such that for every directed edge uv from vertex
  u to vertex v, u comes before v in the ordering.

* Kruskal: is a minimum-spanning-tree algorithm which finds an edge of the least possible weight that connects any two
  trees in the forest.

* Prim: is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph

* Dijkstra: computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of the other vertices in a graph with
  non-negative edge cost.

* Yen: computes K-shortest loopless paths between two vertex in a graph with non-negative edge cost.

* Kisp: computes K-shortest independent paths between two vertex in a graph with non-negative edge cost.

* BellmanFord: computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of the other vertices in a weighted digraph
  with positive or negative edge weights.

* FloydWarshall: computes all-pairs shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights (but with
  no negative cycles).

* EdmondsKarp: computes the maximum flow in a flow network(graph).

## Requirements

##### Download this package and its dependency

    go get github.com/starwander/GoFibonacciHeap
    go get github.com/starwander/goraph

##### Implements Vertex interface of this package if you want to use AddVertexWithEdges(optional):

```go
type Vertex interface {
	ID() ID
	Edges() []Edge
}

type Edge interface {
	Get() (from ID, to ID, weight float64)
}
```

## Supported Operations

* Graph operations:

- GetVertex: get a vertex by input id.
- GetEdge: gets the edge between the two vertices by input ids.
- GetEdgeWeight: gets the weight of the edge between the two vertices by input ids.
- AddVertex: adds a new vertex into the graph.
- AddEdge: adds a new edge between the vertices by the input ids.
- UpdateEdgeWeight: updates the weight of the edge between vertices by the input ids.
- DeleteVertex: deletes a vertex from the graph and gets the value of the vertex.
- DeleteEdge: deletes the edge between the vertices by the input id from the graph and gets the value of edge.
- AddVertexWithEdges: adds a vertex value which implements Vertex interface.
- CheckIntegrity: checks if any edge connects to or from unknown vertex.
- GetPathWeight: gets the total weight along the path by input ids.
- DisableEdge: disables the edge for further calculation.
- DisableVertex: disables the vertex for further calculation.
- DisablePath: disables all the vertices in the path for further calculation.
- Reset: enables all vertices and edges for further calculation.

* Algorithm operations:

- Dijkstra: gets the shortest path from one vertex to all other vertices in the graph.
- Yen: gets top k shortest loopless path between two vertex in the graph.
- Kisp: gets top k shortest independent path between two vertex in the graph.
